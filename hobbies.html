  <p><bold style="color: red;">Good day, ACUITES.</bold>
    When I think about Ajayi Crowther University, I don’t just see a school. I see a community filled with potential, brilliant minds, hidden talents, and endless opportunities waiting to be unlocked. But here’s the truth: outside these gates, we’re still unheard of.

    I’ve felt it personally. During my internships with three multinational companies, I had to explain “what” my school was because no one knew ACU. In 200 level, as a first-class student, I applied to a multinational alongside a friend from a bigger school with a second-class grade. He got in; I didn’t.
    
    It hurt, but it opened my eyes. It’s not just about grades, it’s about reputation. And that’s why my vision is to put ACU on the map—where we belong.</p>
    
    
    <h2>My Plan for ACU</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Academic Growth & Excellence (with the vice president & a chairman job acquisition committee)
    -Build a stronger academic community with mentorship programs and career tools.
    -Connect students to internships and job opportunities to ensure everyone graduates prepared.
    </li>
    <li>  Improved Sports Life (with sport director & a chairman sports committee)
      -Organize inter-university competitions to showcase our talent on a larger stage.
      -Strengthen in-campus sports events and create a fitness community for advanced “fit fams” and beginners alike.
      </li>
      <li> A Better Social Life (with social director)
        -As your Social Director in 22/23, I organized the most active calendar ACU has ever seen. I’ll go even further: cultural events, creative showcases, and lobby for a proper final year week to celebrate our graduates.
      </li>
      <li> Welfare & Exposure (with welfare director & a chairperson media and pr)
        -Fight for adequate power and water supply while pushing for student welfare initiatives.
        -Launch a “Save 20 ACUITES” campaign to support struggling students financially.
        -Collaborate with the media and content creators to boost ACU’s recognition beyond campus.</li>
        <li> Leadership with Integrity (with the SRC, CEC & all appointees)
          -Accountability will be the foundation of my administration. Every exco will deliver results, not just promises.
         </li>
  </ol>
    
    <h2>Why Me?</h2>
    <P>Since 100 level, I’ve worked tirelessly to serve ACUSA, first passively, then actively. As Social Director, I completed every promise in my manifesto. As Head of Media, I did the same. I’ve studied past administrations to understand what worked, what didn’t, and why.

    But this isn’t just about me. It’s about us. Together, we can turn potential into progress and make ACU a name that commands respect everywhere.
    
    Let’s make it happen. Let’s make history.

    Thank you.</bold></p>
